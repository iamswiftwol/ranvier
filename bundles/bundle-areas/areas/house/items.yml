A banner held aloft by two winged Lions is emblazoned with the word "WEALTH," at the top of the tapestry. What you find most intriguing, however, is what lies behind the curtain; where moths have eaten away the upper corner of the cloth, the tapestry hangs slightly askew to reveal the seam of what can only be a secret door.

Crisp ivy and fragrant pine boughs drape the walls in garlands. Heaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, are wildebeest, antelope, game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, long wreaths of warthog-sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, savory grasses for cats to gnaw on, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that make the chamber dim with their delicious steam.
