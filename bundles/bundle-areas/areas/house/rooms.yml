  description: >-
    You stand in the courtyard of an old, delapidated banking house on a lonely street in the great city of Liondon. It is Christmas Eve, but a cold fog has descended to steal the joy from this holiday evening. Behind you on the distant street, fellow Lions pass by, growling about the unmerry weather and rubbing their paws together in their coat pockets to stay warm. Gas lamps from the street only dimly light the courtyard, and the candles that flare in the windows of the neighbouring offices are only ruddy smears upon the palpable gray air. The <b>fog</b> is so dense that although the courtyard is narrow, the closest buildings are mere phantoms.

    You approach the large wooden front door to the banking house. In the dim light of the courtyard, you see a Lion's head <b>door-knocker</b>, its bronze tarnished with age and encrusted in frost. There is something unusual about this door-knocker, however...

    You enter the darkened foyer of the old building. The heavy door slams shut behind you and the sound resounds through the house like thunder. This building must have once been a busy banking house, with accounting offices here on the ground floor and living quarters for the owner on the floors above. It is silent now though: no sounds from the street or notes of Christmas cheer reach this place tonight. You are startled when a small gas lamp on the wall suddenly sputters to life on its own and casts eerie, flickering shadows across the peeling wallpaper. The air is heavy with the musty scent of old Lion fur. Upon the wall hangs a framed business <b>certificate</b> behind dusty glass. Perhaps it can offer a clue as to whose home and office you've entered.

    You step quietly into a room that appears to have been some kind of study.

You love libraries but this one is a little too dreary for your liking. You are about to leave when your eye catches sight of an ancient <b>desk</b> at the back of the room.

You find his piercing golden eyes unsettling.

It was here that the firm's accountants must have toiled away their days, reconciling payments and invoices, and logging every financial transaction of the company. Between the lecterns is a blackened iron stove, next to which you see a <b>pail</b> full of coals. Your keen nose barely catches the lingering, dirty scent of creosote and sulpher, but it has been many years since there was ever an ember lit to warm the room. On one of the lecterns, you notice a very old <b>book</b>, its spine embossed in dull gold writing.

The peaked wooden roof rises in a triumph of beams overhead. As the bats settle, the dark, empty room is oppressively silent.

Against the far wall stands an enormous grandfather <b>clock</b> next to a door in the painted panels.

  description: >-
    You have the grim thought that should anything sinister befall you tonight, you would likely remain undiscovered in this labyrinth for years to come. You make a silent wish that the blessings of Christmas Eve and the good-hearted Spirits you've met tonight might protect you. Your gaze is drawn to the ancient stone plaque embedded in the damp wall. It bears the cryptic inscription of two numbers: 7,6.

    Entering this chamber, deep in the subterranean labyrinth, your gaze is drawn to the ancient stone plaque set in the damp wall. Its surface bears the cryptic inscription of two numbers, 7,7. But your attention immediately turns to a <b>pool</b> of black water in an enormous stone basin in the middle of the room, as well as to an ancient looking wooden <b>chest</b> in the corner. Something is terribly dreadful about this room, but it is a fear you know you must now face, with all the courage a Lion can muster.
