One panel shows you as an impoverished little Cub in school, excitedly waiting for your beloved sister to arrive and take you to Old Fuzzywig's Christmas party to start the holiday break. Another panel depicts your first romantic courtship, and the Christmas Eve when you happily swore to be faithful in love despite your modest means. Finally, on the far wall, there is another panel that memorializes what now lives in your heart in shame: the Christmas you turned aside from that love, vowing instead to amass your fortune in the world of business. "Spirit!" you exclaim as aching sadness creeps into your thoughts, "Show me no more." How could you have been so happy once with so little, you wonder. And why do you feel so unsatisfied now that you have so much more? As you find yourself overwhelmed by these thoughts, the Spirit's light grows to a room-blinding white, and you shield your eyes with your paws. A great howling wind rises and tousles your fur. You hear the grandfather clock groan and fall with a deafening crash on the floor, wood snapping and metal clanging. When the light dims and the sound subsides, you find yourself completely alone amidst the wreckage. A small Gold Key gleams on the floor.`);
